## tinytorch



Newest ML framework that you propbaly don't need, <br>
this is really autograd engine backed by numpy<br><br>

#### why this exists
Bcs I was bored 


#### Visulization 
If you want to see your computation graph run visulize.py

requirements
```bash
pip install graphviz
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz # IDK what to do for windows I use wsl
```


#### powerlevel
1.0 -  karpathy [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) (really simple, not much you can do with it) <br>
3.14 -  [tinytorch](https://github.com/joey00072/nanograd) (simpile and you can do lot of things with it) <= ❤️ <br>
69 - [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) (no longer simple you can do lot more)<br>
∞  -  [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) (goat library, that makes gpu go burrr)<br>
